### Introducing the Django Admin
[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial02/#introducing-the-django-admin]

Philosophy

Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.

Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between “content publishers” and the “public” site. Site managers use the system to add news stories, events, sports scores, etc., and that content is displayed on the public site. Django solves the problem of creating a unified interface for site administrators to edit content.

The admin isn’t intended to be used by site visitors. It’s for site managers.

# Create an admin user

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

# Visit the GUI 
python manage.py runserver
then go to the admin route and login
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

# Make the poll app modifiable in the admin

```py polls/admin.py 
from .models import Question

admin.site.register(Question)
```

Note the history option in the top right (its hard to see)
