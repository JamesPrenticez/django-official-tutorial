### Playing around in the terminal

We can play around with the free API Django gives us in the terminal.

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

We’re using this instead of simply typing “python”, because manage.py sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable, which gives Django the Python import path to your mysite/settings.py file.


```bash
# Import the model classes we just wrote.
from polls.models import Choice, Question

# No questions are in the system yet.
Question.objects.all()

# Create a new Question.
# Support for time zones is enabled in the default settings file, so
# Django expects a datetime with tzinfo for pub_date. Use timezone.now()
# instead of datetime.datetime.now() and it will do the right thing.
from django.utils import timezone
q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())
q.save()

# Now it has an ID
q.id

# and a "question text"
q.question_text

# and a "pub date"
 q.pub_date

# We can chagne the values.
q.question_text = "What is your favorite color?"
q.save()
```

### Updating the Models method

When we use **Question.objects.all()** we get back <QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]> which is not very helpful

So if we go to the poll/models.py and add the __str()__ method to them we can see more.

```py poll/models.py
class Question(models.Model):
    # ...
    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text

class Choice(models.Model):
    # ...
    def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```

It’s important to add __str__() methods to your models, not only for your own convenience when dealing with the interactive prompt, but also because objects’ representations are used throughout Django’s automatically-generated admin.

We also add this method:

```py polls/models.py
import datetime

from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Question(models.Model):
    # ...
    def was_published_recently(self):
        return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
```

### Playing around in the terminal after making some changes

```bash
# Import out models
from polls.models import Choice, Question

# Look up our question by primary key
Question.objects.get(pk=1)

# Look up our question by id
Question.objects.filter(id=1)

# Look up our question by query string
Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith="What")

# Look up our question by date published
from django.utils import timezone
current_year = timezone.now().year
Question.objects.get(pub_date__year=current_year)

# Use our custom methods
q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
q.was_published_recently()
```

### Adding some choices to our question
```bash 
# Import out models
from polls.models import Choice, Question

# Set the variable and see whats in it
q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
q.choice_set.all()

# Create three choices.
q.choice_set.create(choice_text="red", votes=0)
q.choice_set.create(choice_text="green", votes=0)
q.choice_set.create(choice_text="blue", votes=0)

# Check what we just made
q.choice_set.all()
q.choice_set.count()

# Find all Choices for any question whose pub_date is in this year
# The API automatically follows relationships as far as you need.
# Use double underscores to separate relationships.
Choice.objects.filter(question__pub_date__year=current_year)

# Delete one of the choices. Use delete() for that.
c = q.choice_set.filter(choice_text__startswith="Just hacking")
c.delete()
```
