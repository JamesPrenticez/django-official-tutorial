###### SQLITE and links to help with other DB
By default, the configuration uses SQLite. SQLite is included in Python, so you won’t need to install anything .

If you wish to use another database, install the appropriate database bindings [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/install/#database-installation]

If you are not using SQLite as your database, additional settings such as USER, PASSWORD, and HOST must be added. For more details, see the reference documentation for DATABASES.
[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-DATABASES]

###### Timezone Setting
```py mysite/settings.py
  TIME_ZONE = 'Pacific/Auckland'
```
(list of time zones)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones]

Note that this isn’t necessarily the time zone of the server. For example, one server may serve multiple Django-powered sites, each with a separate time zone setting.

###### Installed Apps
django.contrib.admin – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/#module-django.contrib.admin]
django.contrib.auth – An authentication system. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/#module-django.contrib.auth]
django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#module-django.contrib.contenttypes]
django.contrib.sessions – A session framework. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/http/sessions/#module-django.contrib.sessions]
django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/messages/#module-django.contrib.messages]
django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#module-django.contrib.staticfiles]

Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command

###### Migrate 

```bash 
  python manage.py migrate
```

The migrate command looks at the **INSTALLED_APPS** setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py file and the database migrations shipped with the app
